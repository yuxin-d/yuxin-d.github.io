Todo List Application is a simple application that operated on both Windows and Mac OS, provides users with wonderful task management experience with its clean, simplified and user-friendly GUI.


This Todo List application was the first personal java programming project I completed. The idea of having my own todolist application came to my mind after I completed my first university software construction course and I realized none of the task management software out there really meet my needs. <br>If anyone is interested in trying out this app, you are more than welcome to visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/yuxin-d/todoList_App) site to download it from the repository :D
