Todo List Application is a simple application that operated on both Windows and Mac OS, provides users with wonderful task management experience with its clean, simplified and user-friendly GUI.

This Todo List application was the first personal programming project I have ever completed. The idea of having my own todolist application came to my mind after I completed my first university software construction course and I realized none of the task management software out there really meet my needs. If anyone is interested in trying out this app, you are more than welcome to visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/yuxin-d/todoList_App) site to download it from the repository :D

KEY FEATURES:

- Personalized Login Window, requires username and passwords, allows multi-user access while providing privacy securities.

- Kept track of important dates and events, providing alters to users one day before the due date

- Cross off a finished item at any time!

- Included an overdue change that reminded users that an overdue item exists in the todo list

- Enables users to save and load user data from existed files
