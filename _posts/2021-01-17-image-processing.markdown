Here is a project for image processing
<br>
<br>
The image processing project for object recognition is an advanced image recognition system that leverages artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to accurately identify and classify objects and scenes within images. 
<br>
<br>
This project has the potential to be applied in various fields, including healthcare, autonomous vehicles, security, and more.
