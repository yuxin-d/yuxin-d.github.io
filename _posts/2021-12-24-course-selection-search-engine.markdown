*This is a full stack development project, designed for UBC student to do course and professor search* 
It will benefit student to do course selection.

### Intro
<br>
UBC is a big place, and involves a large number of people doing a variety of tasks. The goal of this project is to provide a way to 
<br>
perform some of the tasks required to run the university and to enable effective querying of the metadata from around campus. 
<br>
This will involve working with courses, prerequisites, past course averages, room scheduling, and timetable creation.
<br>
This will be a full stack web development project split into four sprints. The first three sprints are server-side development using Node. The fourth sprint is client-side development.
<br>
Development will be done with TypeScript and the packages and libraries you use will be strictly limited

## This specification might seem intimidating, but keep in mind that this project has the same interaction mechanism as most software systems:

1. It consumes input data (the zip file).

2. It transforms the data (according to the query).

3. It returns a result.
